 * Autoplace specification is used to determine which entities are placed when generating map.
 * Currently it is used for enemy bases, resources and other entities (trees, fishes, ...).
 * 
 * Note: The property names and types on this page are up to date.
 * However, most of the textual components of this page have not been updated since 2016,
 * so they are not reliable for the latest version of the game.
